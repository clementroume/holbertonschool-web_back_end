## Learning Objectives

By the end of this repository, the following concepts should be clearly understood and mastered:

### **Caching**

- Understand the purpose and benefits of caching systems.
- Implement various cache replacement strategies, including FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU.
- Evaluate trade-offs in different caching strategies.
- Build clean, testable Python code with method overriding and class inheritance.
- Follow best practices such as `pycodestyle` guidelines for writing Python code.

---

By applying these techniques, this repository provides the fundamental skills necessary to handle back-end data efficiently using various caching strategies in Python.
