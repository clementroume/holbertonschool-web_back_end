## Description

This repository contains multiple projects that help build a strong foundation in back-end web development. Topics covered include:

- **Caching**: Implement various caching strategies using Python, focusing on cache replacement algorithms and optimizing data retrieval.
- **Personal Data Protection**: Learn how to securely handle personally identifiable information (PII), including obfuscation in logs, password encryption, and safe database practices.

The tasks in this repository gradually increase in complexity, providing practical scenarios to explore best practices and optimize workflows.

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s an overview of the directories included in the repository:

| **Directory**       | **Description**                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `caching`           | This project explores implementing caching strategies such as FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU in Python to optimize back-end data handling.   |
| `personal_data`     | This project focuses on protecting personal user information by filtering PII in logs, encrypting passwords using bcrypt, and using environment variables securely. |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this repository, the following concepts should be clearly understood and mastered:

### **Caching**

- Understand the purpose and benefits of caching systems.
- Implement various cache replacement strategies, including FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU.
- Evaluate trade-offs in different caching strategies.
- Build clean, testable Python code with method overriding and class inheritance.

### **Personal Data Protection**

- Identify Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and implement methods to protect it.
- Create custom logging filters to obfuscate sensitive data in logs.
- Safely hash and verify passwords using the `bcrypt` library.
- Use environment variables to securely handle database credentials.
